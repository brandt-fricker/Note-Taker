## Introduction
If you're tired of making notes, lists, anything you need to remember for the day on scratch pieces of paper only to later on in the day "misplace" it because it was written on the back of a receipt (because that's what was within arms reach of when these tasks/epiphanies/whatever came into my mind) and come to find out it was thrown away, the kids added to your list with crayon and marker scribbles to the point that your writing not in any sort of language anymore, or you just lose things easily. The Note-Taker will make your day. By having all your notes safe from the trash, the kids, and whatever disasters come your way. 

## Description

## Introduction
Are you tired of making notes, lists, or anything you need to remember for the day on scratch pieces of paper only to later on in the day "misplace" it because it was written on the back of a receipt because that's what was within arms reach when these tasks/epiphanies/whatever came into your mind? Have you come to find out your list was thrown away, or your kids have added to your list with crayon and marker scribble to the point that your writing is not in any sort of language, or do you just lose things easily? The Note-Taker will make your day by having all your notes safe from the trash, the kids, and whatever disasters come your way.  

## Description
 Note-Taker can be used to write, save, and delete notes to help with organizing your busy everyday life.
